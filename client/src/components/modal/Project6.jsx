                I personally think that hosing any media-related data on cloud is the most efficient and hassle-free way.
               My resum√© is hosted on cloud so that when the client clicks on it, it simply redirects to the hosted URL.
               Another interesting thing is the message section. The messages, upon sending, goes into a cloud database.
               What I am working on is, to try to have the message relay directly into my gmail account.

                The most fun part for me was making the website interactive. 
                To do this in React.js, you can use conditional rendering to render components that are necessary.
                That is the power of React - you can divide your code into reusable components.
                Another fun part, is using libraries like bootstrap to enhance the user experience.
